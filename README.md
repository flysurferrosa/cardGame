cardGame

This card game is based loosely on War.  There are two players, the full deck of 52 cards is divided up (using random index numbers) between the two players equally.  The first player plays his top card, then the next player does the same, they continue to do this until the card played matches the last card played.  Whoever played the match takes the pile and adds it to their cards.  In my version of war however, instead of adding the pile to the players cards (the game was going on forever), I added the pile in the middle to a new array for each player, and whoever had more cards in this pile at the end wins.  Since my function uses concattonate more cards are actually generated with this function than we started with in the original deck, so to keep them out of play and to seek an ending to the game I created the "point piles" on either team.  The game plays until one player runs out of cards and at that point the player who has the most cards in his/her point pile wins.
